There are two variants of the Repap Wilson design.  Some of the RP parts are common, and those STL files are located in this main directory.

The parts that are specific to one version or the other are located in the respective subfolders.

The BOM will tell you how many of which parts you will need to build the printer.

Notes about updates:

6/21/14 - I've modified a few models described below:

1. The Y belt holder now has a tensioner (yay) affixed to the side. Use
   a M3 x 20 or longer screw and nut to push the little round piece against
   the side of the belt after assembly.  

2. The fan duct for the extruder has been redesigned so that there are 
   separate outlets for the top of the hot end and below the nozzle.  This
   has been working great for me for PLA; ABS prints may not want that lower
   outlet blowing on the print so I'll archive the original fan duct as well.

3. The extruder body itself should now print better.  The opening for the 
   608 bearings on the sides has been marginally increased, as has been the
   J-Head hole on the bottom.  The opening for the hobbed bolt was cleared
   out to remove some extraneous support material.  Also, the distance 
   between the M3 screws for the hot end attachment was decreased by about
   1mm to get a better grip on the J-Head.

4. The Y ends for the TS were changed just a wee bit to make the holes come
   out more suitable (when sliced and printed with a .5mm nozzle) and also
   to add .5mm of height to the feet so that the printer won't tend to rock
   on the central frame.
